        AG (DAG), the manufacturer of smart vehicles, has determined that in certain
        Model Year 2014 - 2015 smart vehicles, the bolts that fasten the steering
        gear to the front cross member might have been manufactured outside specifications.  Due
        to a production deviation at a supplier, a certain batch of bolts might not
        meet the endurance requirements.  These bolts might break during the lifetime
        of the vehicle if exposed to high loads in combination with vibrations. Should
        one of the two bolts on the cross member break, drivers would be alerted by
        perceptible noises while driving, a potentially tilted steering wheel position
        and potentially the activation of the ESP warning lamp.  In the event of a
        broken bolt, vehicle handling would be impacted, increasing the risk of a
        crash.  An authorized smart dealer will  replace the two bolts that fasten
        the steering gear to the front cross member.   NHTSA Recall Campaign 15V192","refreshDate":"","remedyDescription":"An
