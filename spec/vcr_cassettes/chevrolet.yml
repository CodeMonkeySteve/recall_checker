        has decided that a defect which relates to motor vehicle safety exists in
        all 2010-2014 model year Chevrolet Camaro vehicles.  There is a risk, under
        certain conditions, that some drivers may bump the ignition key with their
        knee and unintentionally move the key away from the \"run\" position.  If
        this occurs, engine power, and power braking will be affected and power steering
        may be affected, increasing the risk of a crash.","safety_risk_description":"The
        timing of the key movement out of the \"run\" position, relative to the activation
        of the sensing algorithm of the crash event, may result in the airbags not
        deploying, increasing the potential for occupant injury in certain kinds of
        crashes.  Until the recall has been performed, it is very important that drivers
        adjust their seat and steering column to allow clearance between their knee
        and the ignition key.","remedy_description":"Dealers are to provide two replacement
        key rings. Vehicles with slotted keys will also receive key inserts. This
        will be provided free of charge. Please contact your dealer now to order parts.

        your seat and steering column to allow clearance between your knee and the
